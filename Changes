Revision history for Perl extension Inline::TT.

0.05  Mon May 16 10:04:05 CDT 2005
	- cleaned documentation slightly
	- cleaned MANIFEST
	- resubmitted to CPAN since 0.04 was not indexed due to ownership
	  conflict (I sent 0.04 up before being made co-maintainer).

0.04  Fri May 13 13:04:38 CDT 2005
	- added tests to verify that INCLUDE directive works, PROCESS was not
	  tested, but persumably works since the differences are inside TT
	- added examples directory and the simple example.  Not coincidentally
	  it looks a lot like t/02_simple.t
	- added info support, so using perl -MInline=INFO program returns
	  a list of bound subs extracted from tt2 blocks (this only works
	  if a good _Inline or equivalent directory exists, otherwise callers
	  are instructed to rerun).

0.03  Mon Apr 11 10:46:02 2005
	- since I could not make Inline-TT-0.02 work, I started from scratch
	  as I worked, I looked at the original version frequently, so I
	  say thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for the original
	- my version was created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-AXn Inline::TT

After version 0.02, Phil Crow took over maintanence from Tatsuhiko Miyagawa.
